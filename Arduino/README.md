===================================

<img src="https://github.com/CongducPham/PRIMA-Intel-IrriS/blob/main/images/github-intel-irris-device.png" width="300">


This is the source code of the generic IoT sensor platform. It can handle up to 2 analog soil humidity sensors.

It supports DIY Arduino ProMini, WaziSense and WaziDev development lines. For WaziSense and WaziDev, the embedded I2C SI7021 sensor can be activated to measure conditions in the device casing, as well as the solar charging circuit (WaziSense) or battery voltage level (WaziDev).

It can be configured as LoRaWAN 1.0 device for both uplink and downlink transmissions.

Enjoy!
