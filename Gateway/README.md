WaziGate framework for the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project
====================================================

The INTEL-IRRIS gateway is based on the [WaziGate framework](https://www.waziup.io/documentation/wazigate/) from WAZIUP e.V.

INTEL-IRRIS is providing a customized WaziGate distribution so that the starter-kit can work out-of-the-box.

Check on [INTEL-IRRIS web site](http://intel-irris.eu/results) for the SD card image in either EU433 or EU868 frequency band.

Just get the SD card image, flash it on an 8GB SD card class 10 and plug it into a Raspberry Pi (3B/3B+/4B, although 3B is recommended) with a LoRa hat.

The additional code on top of the generic WaziGate framework is provided in this folder, although the SD card image has already everything installed.


Enjoy!
